Objective: Enhance the usability and functionality of your API by implementing filtering, searching, and ordering capabilities. This task focuses on providing users with the tools to easily access and manipulate the data presented through your API.
Task Description:

For this task within your advanced-api-project, you will add advanced query capabilities to your existing views that manage the Book model. This will allow API consumers to filter, search, and order the books based on different criteria.
Step 1: Set Up Filtering

    Action Items:
        Integrate Django REST Framework’s filtering capabilities to allow users to filter the book list by various attributes like title, author, and publication_year.
        Use DRF’s DjangoFilterBackend or similar tools to set up comprehensive filtering options in your ListView.

Step 2: Implement Search Functionality

    Search Setup:
        Enable search functionality on one or more fields of the Book model, such as title and author.
        Configure the SearchFilter in your API to allow users to perform text searches on these fields.

Step 3: Configure Ordering

    Ordering Configuration:
        Allow users to order the results by any field of the Book model, particularly title and publication_year.
        Set up the OrderingFilter to provide front-end flexibility in sorting query results.

Step 4: Update API Views

    View Modifications:
        Adjust your BookListView to incorporate filtering, searching, and ordering functionalities.
        Ensure that these capabilities are clearly defined and integrated into the view logic.

Step 5: Test API Functionality

    Testing Guidelines:
        Test the filtering, searching, and ordering features to ensure they work correctly.
        Use API testing tools like Postman or curl to make requests with various query parameters to evaluate how the API handles them.

Step 6: Document the Implementation

    Documentation Requirements:
        Detail how filtering, searching, and ordering were implemented in your views.
        Include examples of how to use these features in API requests in the project documentation or code comments.


Objective: Develop and execute comprehensive unit tests for your Django REST Framework APIs to ensure the integrity of your endpoints and the correctness of response data and status codes.
Task Description:

In this task within your advanced-api-project, you will create unit tests for the API endpoints you’ve developed, focusing on testing their functionality, response data integrity, and status code accuracy. This ensures that your API behaves as expected under various conditions and inputs. The tests should be written in the /api/test_views.py file
Step 1: Understand What to Test

    Identify Key Areas:
        Focus on testing CRUD operations for the Book model endpoints.
        Test the filtering, searching, and ordering functionalities to verify they work as intended.
        Ensure that permissions and authentication mechanisms are correctly enforcing access controls.

Step 2: Set Up Testing Environment

    Configure Test Settings:
        Use Django’s built-in test framework which is based on Python’s unittest module.
        Configure a separate test database to avoid impacting your production or development data.

Step 3: Write Test Cases

    Develop Test Scenarios:
        Write tests that simulate API requests and check for correct status codes and response data. This includes:
        Creating a Book and ensuring the data is correctly saved and returned.
        Updating a Book and verifying the changes are reflected.
        Deleting a Book and ensuring it is removed from the database.
        Testing each endpoint with appropriate authentication and permission scenarios to ensure security controls are effective.

Step 4: Run and Review Tests

    Execute Tests:
        Run your test suite using Django’s manage.py command: bash python manage.py test api
        Review the outputs and fix any issues or bugs identified by the tests.

Step 5: Document Your Testing Approach

    Testing Documentation:
        Document your testing strategy and individual test cases.
        Provide guidelines on how to run the tests and interpret test results.
